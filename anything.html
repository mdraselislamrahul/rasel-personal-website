               <b>HTML-5</b>
               <p>HTML is a type of computer language.

                And, by using this computer language, various types of websites or webpages are created and designed.
                
                Also, if you are thinking of creating a blog or website,
                
                "Then knowledge of HTML must be there".
                That is, this tag is used to skip writing one line and start writing from another line. There are other tags which are specially used like image tag, input tag. Tags Description <html> </html> Indicates an HTML document.</p>

            <ul>

            </ul>
             <b>CSS-3</b>
             <p>Before CSS, any web document had no structure, style or design.

              Meaning, when a website or web page was visited, there was nothing but chaotic TEXT.
              
              And so, no one likes to read these simple texts.
              
              However, HTML style tags were developed to solve this problem.
              
              But even this problem could not be solved.
              
              And so this style tag has been further developed to develop a different type of web document language (web document language).
              
              And the name of this modern web document language is “CSS”</p>
        </div>

            </ul>
             <b>BOOTSTROP</b>
             <p>Bootstrap has a nice grid system. Through which a webpage can be divided into 12 parts and the desired content can be placed. Apart from bootstrap, you can write the style yourself and divide it into 12 parts, but why waste 8-10 minutes on a task that you can do in 30-40 seconds without any difficulty?

              Additionally, Bootstrap has many classes already styled. We are done when we can only call out the names of the class in time. Can't figure it out? We give different styles to the class that we write in div or different tags. Many such classes are already nicely styled in Bootstrap.</p>

          <p>Cascading Style Sheets Level 3 (CSS3) is the iteration of the CSS standard used in the styling and formatting of Web pages. CSS3 incorporates the CSS2 standard with some changes and improvements. A key change is the division of standard into separate modules, which makes it easier to learn and understand.</p>
          <p> CSS3 is used with HTML to create and format content structure. It is responsible for colours, font properties, text alignments, background images, graphics, tables, etc. It provides the positioning of various elements with the values being fixed, absolute, and relative</p>
          <p>CSS is important for web designers

            Cascading Style Sheets are an important way to control how your web pages look. CSS controls the fonts, text, colors, backgrounds, margins, and layout. CSS offers several significant advantages over alternative approaches to web design</p>
            <p>A CSS rule consists of a CSS selector and a set of CSS properties. The CSS selector determines what HTML elements to target with the CSS rule. The CSS properties specifies what to style of the targeted HTML elements.</p>
            <p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon </p>

          <p>Bootstrap 5 is the newest version of Bootstrap, which is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for creating responsive, mobile-first websites. Bootstrap 5 is completely free to download and use!</p>
          <p>Bootstrap 5 (the current major version, released in May 2021) has brought with it tons of changes and improvements, including the addition of new components, new classes, new styling for old components, updated browser support, the removal of some old components, and much more.</p>
          <p>Bootstrap 5 is designed to be used without jQuery, but it's still possible to use our components with jQuery. If Bootstrap detects jQuery in the window object it'll add all of our components in jQuery's plugin system; this means you'll be able to do $('[data-bs-toggle="tooltip"]').</p>

          <p>Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user's behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation. The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries.</p>
          <p>Responsive web design, also called RWD design, describes a modern web design approach that allows websites and pages to render (or display) on all devices and screen sizes by automatically adapting to the screen, whether it's a desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, or even a smart TV!</p>
          <p>Responsive web design works through Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), using various settings to serve different style properties depending on the screen size, orientation, resolution, color capability, and other characteristics of the user's device. A few examples of CSS properties related to responsive web design include the viewport and media queries.</p>
